# MATLAB-Simulink-pH-Detection-and-Regulation
This Simulink model detects and regulates the pH level of a solution. It uses a pH sensor to measure the pH, processes the signal to determine the pH range, and controls a water pump to adjust the pH level. Key components include voltage reading, range detection, ON/OFF control, and time delay mechanisms to ensure accurate and stable pH regulation.
